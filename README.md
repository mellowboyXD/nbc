# Naive Bayes Classifier

I recently watched a youtube coding session by Mistah aZozin (@Tsoding) and he 
motivated me to implement my own version of the spam filtering algorithm.

It is not perfect. I do not even know how accurate it is. I could find out but
I want to move on from this project. I could also train the model on more 
dataset but my computer can't handle it. 8D GOTTA BUY MORE RAM!

I did learn a lot however, and I am very pleased with what I achieved. Next 
topic will probably have to be on writing my own allocator specifically using 
Arenas as I think they make memory management so simple. I should also start 
using the concepts of StringBuilder, StringView and dynamic arrays as structs 
with macros. It makes everything so much more enjoyable. I could write a utility
lib that I can include in all of my future projects as well.

### Compile with make

`make`

I am officially signing off of this project. It has been very fun. I gotta 
pickup where I left off in my pacman kinda-clone game. XD
